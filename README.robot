1. Line Detection and Navigation
Objective: Drive straight over 6 feet and detect single and double white lines.
•	Sensors: Utilize line sensors (e.g., infrared or optical sensors) to differentiate between single and double white lines on the ground.
•	Implementation:
o	Program the vehicle to maintain a straight trajectory using feedback from onboard sensors.
o	Implement a line detection algorithm to distinguish between single and double lines. Use different colored LEDs to indicate the type of 
line detected (e.g., red LED for single line, green LED for double line).
•	Validation: Test the vehicle on a course with a known sequence of lines to ensure accurate detection and signaling.
2. Wireless Control and Boundary Detection
Objective: Receive commands from a base station and detect out-of-bounds lines.
•	Hardware: Set up radios and voltage regulators to establish a reliable communication channel between the vehicle and the base station.
•	Implementation:
o	Develop a user interface on the base station to send commands (forward, backward, turn) using buttons or a joystick.
o	Integrate boundary detection in the vehicle’s navigation system to recognize when it drives out of the designated area, using additional line sensors or dedicated boundary markers.
o	Use LEDs to provide visual feedback on boundary status.
•	Validation: Perform controlled tests to ensure the vehicle responds accurately to remote commands and correctly identifies and signals
boundary breaches.
3. Fire Detection and Ladder Mechanism
Objective: Detect IR signals from "burning buildings" and operate a ladder mechanism.
•	Components:
o	IR Detection: Equip the vehicle with an IR receiver to detect signals from buildings.
o	Ladder Mechanism: Design and build a mechanical system capable of extending to reach a building’s roof and retracting after deployment.
o	Break Beam Sensor Interaction: Ensure the vehicle’s ladder interacts with the break beam sensor to simulate extinguishing the fire.
•	Implementation:
o	Program the vehicle to respond to IR signals by stopping and operating the ladder.
o	Use distinct LEDs to indicate IR detection and successful fire extinguishing.
•	Validation: Test the vehicle in a mock setup to ensure it can locate IR signals, deploy the ladder accurately, and respond to the break 
beam sensor as expected.
Final Integration and Testing
•	Integration: Combine all individual systems—navigation, wireless control, line detection, IR detection, and the ladder mechanism—into a 
single autonomous vehicle.
•	Testing:
o	Perform comprehensive tests in an environment that simulates the competition arena.
o	Use mock trials to adjust parameters and improve system reliability and accuracy.
•	Iteration: Based on testing feedback, make necessary adjustments to the hardware setup and software algorithms to enhance performance 
and ensure compliance with the competition rules.
